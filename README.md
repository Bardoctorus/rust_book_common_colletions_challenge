# Rust Book Chapter 8 Common Collections Challenges

At the end of [Chapter 8 of the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html) There are a couple of coding challenges. This is just me banging my noob head against rust to solve them.

If I'm feeling fancy I might iterate over it to show how I improve it but likely not.
